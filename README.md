Web game "Bejeweled" 

This is a basic version of the game Bejeweled, built using Sencha Ext.js framework.
To run the game locally: download bejeweled folder and open index.html in Chrome.
Swap tiles by selecting them to match rows or columns of 3 or more jewels of the same color. For each tile in a match you get +10 points. +5 additional points for longer match. 
 
Some other features I thought about/want to implement: leadership score board, adjustable game board size.
Time spent: ~20 hours.
